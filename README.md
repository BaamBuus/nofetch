# NOfetch - Neofetch on April Fools

This is NOfetch, a Python-based clone of the popular system information tool Neofetch. 
NOfetch provides system information in a "fun" and epic way. NOfetch is inspired by [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch).

## Features 

* Displays system information using ASCII art logos for different operating systems
* Provides system information such as OS version, architecture, CPU, cores, and RAM
* Easy to use and customizable

## How to use

NOfetch is optimized for Windows and Linux. (MacOS and Linux users have to use the .py file lol)
* 1. Download either the .exe if you're on Windows, or the .py if you're on Linux or MacOS.
* 2. Run the file. A CMD/Terminal window will pop up, slowly showing your system specifications.

## Example output on Linux:

```
                    .88888888:.
                88888888.88888.

OS: Arch Linux
CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz
Cores: 4
RAM: 16GB

Note: The CPU might say something like "Intel64 Family 6 Model 158 Stepping 9, GenuineIntel". I dont know a good way to get rid of that, have mercy pls.
```
btw the ascii art might look a little weird depending on ur system*
